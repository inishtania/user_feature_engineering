# User Feature & Segmentation
In this project, I analyze transaction data from a finance app to understand user characteristics based on their past transactions. The process involved several key steps, including data cleaning , building assumptions to guide the analysis, feature engineering, and segmentation. 

Feature Engineering <br>
I performed feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the data. You can review the details in the PDF document titled Intania_DataScientist_FeatureEngineering that I uploaded.

Segmentation<br>
The project culminated in user segmentation, with findings presented in a Canva presentation. You can access the presentation here
